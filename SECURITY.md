# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the `main` branch is actively maintained.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub Security Advisories to report vulnerabilities privately. If that is not possible, open a GitHub issue with minimal details and the maintainers will follow up for a private report.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide a remediation plan as soon as practical.
