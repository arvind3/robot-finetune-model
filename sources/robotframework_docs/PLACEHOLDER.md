# Robot Framework Docs Placeholder

Download official Robot Framework documentation and place markdown/html/text files in this folder.

Note:
- The dataset builder ignores this placeholder file.
- Production runs should use the seeded `official_*` files or freshly downloaded official docs.

Example sources you can include:
- User guide (HTML or Markdown)
- Built-in libraries docs
- Release notes (optional)

The dataset builder will ingest `.md`, `.html`, and `.txt` files from this directory.
