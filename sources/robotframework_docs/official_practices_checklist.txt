1) Structure
- Keep test suites modular.
- Use resource files for reusable keywords.
- Prefer descriptive test names and keyword names.

2) Reliability
- Prefer condition-based waits over fixed sleep.
- Use retry wrappers for unstable external systems.
- Capture context in teardown when tests fail.

3) Data and Variables
- Keep test data separate from test logic where possible.
- Use Variables/Collections libraries for explicit data handling.

4) Diagnostics
- Log key checkpoints.
- Start debugging with library/resource import validation.
- Reproduce failures with minimal cases.

5) Governance
- Use tags for targeted execution.
- Keep a stable evaluation suite separate from train prompts.
- Gate promotion on comparative metrics and qualitative review.
